# 🌱 Plant Health Regression using Machine Learning

This project applies **regression models** to predict plant health indicators such as **moisture**, **nutrient levels**, or **growth rate** based on various features. The implementation is provided in the notebook `PlantHealthRegression.ipynb`.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- 🎯 **Goal**: Predict quantitative plant health metrics (e.g., moisture, growth rate) from environmental or soil data.
- 🧪 **Approach**: Regression analysis using machine learning
- 📂 **Input**: Dataset with numeric features related to plant/environment conditions
- 📈 **Output**: Continuous value predictions (e.g., moisture %, nutrient concentration)
